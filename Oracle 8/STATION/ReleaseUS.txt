        =======================================================
        I.  Installing SQL-Station
        -------------------------------------------------------
        Before you install SQL-Station, verify that your
        system meets the following minimum requirements:

         - IBM-PC or compatible, 486DX or higher
         - Windows NT or 95  
         - At least 8 Megabytes RAM
         - ORACLE Version 7.1 or higher, AND/OR 
           Microsoft SQL Server 4.0 or higher,  AND/OR
           Sybase SQL Server 4.8 or higher with 32 bit database
           connectivity
         - At least 45 Megabytes of disk space (for the whole suite)

        IMPORTANT NOTE FOR EXISTING Watch-PL USERS:
        If you choose to install the version of Debugger
        on this CD, you should install it in a different
        directory than the existing Watch-PL installation if
        you want to preserve Watch-PL.
              
        To install SQL-Station, follow these steps:

        1.  Insert the CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive, or diskette
            #1 in the floppy drive.

        2.  (Windows NT 3.51): From File Manager, select File, Run.
            (Windows 95): From the Start Menu, select Run.

        3.  Enter d:\setup (where d: is the letter of the
            CD-ROM drive or floppy drive in step 1).

        4.  Follow the prompts as they display.

        
        You are prompted to install copies of the
        following products:

        -  Coder V2.1
        -  Debugger V2.1
        -  Plan Analyzer for Oracle V2.3.2
        -  On-line documentation

        (Products not purchased can also be installed for a 30 day
         evaluation.)
        

        Check whichever products you want to install.

        In addition to the client-side installation, you can choose 
        to perform a server-side installation for each product.
        The server-side installation creates some objects
        on the selected server.  If you choose not to
        do the server-side installations, you can perform them at
        any point by selecting each individual product's Server 
        Install program from the SQL-Station folder/group.

        If you have Microsoft Developer's Studio or Visual
        Basic installed on your machine, you are prompted
        whether to integrate SQL-Station with it.  If you
        choose YES, a SQL-Station menu item is added to your
        Visual Basic/Developer's Studio menubar.
        
        Instructions for performing the server-side installation
        for each product are located in the online help for
        each product, or in the Adobe Acrobat Reader (tm) version
        of the User Guides, found in the DOC directory of the
        CD-ROM (Adobe Acrobat Reader is included on the CD).

        After you have installed SQL-Station successfully,  a
        SQL-Station icon is installed in the
        Program Files/PLATINUM folder, and a shortcut is created 
        in the Start Menu SQL-Station folder (or whatever 
        program group/Folder you specified during the install).  
        To invoke SQL-Station, double click the SQL-Station icon
        (Windows NT 3.51) or select SQL-Station from the 
        SQL-Station folder on the Start Menu (Windows 95 and NT 4).

       
        =======================================================
        II. Technical Notes and Known Problems
        -------------------------------------------------------

        Additional known problems and fixed problems can be found 
        in the product specific release notes.  

        - Oracle SQL*Net contains a bug in versions prior 
          to 2.3.2.16.  If you are using an earlier version
          of SQL*Net and you use TCP/IP to connect to more than
          one Oracle server, the client application behaves as
          if you are connected to the same server twice.
          Oracle is aware of this bug, and they have fixed it
          in SQL*Net version 2.3.2.16 and higher.


        - If you are upgrading from a previous version of
          SQL-Station Coder, you must update any previous Coder
          Server-side installations.  To update Server-side
          installations, simply run the Coder Server Install 
          program on each server you want to access.

        - The documentation for each component of SQL-Station
          can be found in the DOC directory on the SQL-Station
          CD-ROM and can be copied to your hard drive during the
          installation process.  
          For specific information about each SQL-Station
          component, refer to this online documentation, as well
          as the online help provided with each product.

        - If your Oracle database server uses an NLS_DATE_FORMAT
          value (or the default Oracle format that is DD-MON-YY)
          with only 2 digits for the year, Debugger may fail to 
          show the date correctly for years > 2000.  This applies
          to other applications in your environment as well. 
          Changing the setting for the Oracle server to a 4-digit
          will fix the problem after the instance is restarted.  
    
        =======================================================
        III. New Features

         follow:

          - Integration between SQL-Station and Microsoft 
            Developer's Studio and Visual Basic.  
            If you have Developer's Studio or Visual Basic 
            on your machine, you can choose to
            integrate them with Station during the SQL-Station 
            installation. 
            A SQL-Station menu item is added to your
            Visual Basic/Developer's Studio menubar.

            triggering statement in it.

            to denote hints contained in the SQL. Purple is used for 
            SQL reserved words (min, max, etc.).

          - Enhanced Snapshot and Capture performance.
  
          - Captured SQL can now be formatted for improved readability
            by wrapping the lines of the SQL statement, if desired.

          - All data captured using the Snapshot feature is now 
            retained, even after you close and reopen the

          - Double-clicking any captured SQL now causes Plan Analyzer 
            to automatically generate all three optimization plans 
            for the SQL. If hints are included, hints plans are also 
            generated.

          - Plan Analyzer now displays the user name that the SYS user 
            is emulating when optimizing SQL owned by a different
