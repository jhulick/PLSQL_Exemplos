        =======================================================
        I.  Installing SQL-Station Debugger
        -------------------------------------------------------
        Before you install SQL-Station Debugger, verify that your
        system meets the following minimum requirements:

         - IBM-PC or compatable, 486DX or higher
         - Windows-NT or Windows 95
         - 8 Megabytes RAM
         - ORACLE Version 7.1 or higher
         - At least 5 Megabytes of diskspace
         - SQL-Station Coder version 2.0 (installed previously or
           concurrently)

        To install SQL-Station Debugger, follow these steps:

        1.  Insert diskette 1 into the floppy drive (usually A:
            or B:).

        2.  From File Manager, select File, Run.
   
        3.  Enter A:\setup (where A: is the letter of the
            floppy drive in step 1).

        4.  Follow the prompts as they display.

        After you have installed SQL-Station Debugger 
        successfully,  a Debugger icon is installed in the PLATINUM 
        program group (or whatever program group you specified 
        during the install).  To invoke SQL-Station Debugger, 
        double click the icon.


        =======================================================
        II. Technical Notes 
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
	1. Preparing the database server for server-side
         installation(SQLDEBUG):

	   Server-side installation allows the DBA to choose the
         default and the temporary tablespaces from the existing 
         list of tablespaces in the database. Before performing
         the server-side installation, the DBA may want to 
         create a new tablespace for the tables owned by the 
         application owner (SQLDEBUG). The space required for 
         installing the tables in the tablespace is as little 
         as 1MB - However, the DBA may want to allot more space, 
         since the space requirements increase as tables get 
         populated.


	2. SQL-Station Debugger supports all PL/SQL datatypes, 
           with the exception of the following:

           - long
           - pl/sql table
           - anchored types referencing packages
           - cursor variables
           - implicit cursor variables  
   
           The above datatypes will not show up in the watch 
           window. However, for package constants that are 
           global to the currently executing block, you can
           add them directly to the watch window by typing 
           them into the global variable evaluation listbox. 
                    
        3. Debugging a trigger temporarily forces the release 
           version out of the catalog. For this reason, you
           should not debug production triggers.

        4. You cannot debug encrypted procedural objects. To
           debug them, you must first unencrypt the 
           procedural objects.
        
        5. All scalar variables declared using the variable 
           reference type of construction (variable_name%TYPE) 
           can be watched as long as the referenced variable is 
           in the same procedure, function, or package.

        6. The SQL Editor window is now referred to as the
           Edit window.

        7. Clicking an object's code icon in the Catalog Browser
           now opens up a separate Edit window (formerly SQL
           Editor window).

        8. NOTE TO DATABASE ADMINISTRATORS:

		   The server-side installation asks for the DBA
		   password in its initial dialog (the user name
		   is defaulted to SYS in the dialog). This
		   procedure creates the application owner and
		   grants certain privileges to this owner 
		   (defaulted to SQLDEBUG).

           The CREATE.SQL script, located in the Debugger
           install directory, does the following against
		   the  DBA (the login name used in the dialog
		   above) schema:

	   - Grants a set of privileges to the application owner. 
			 When logged in as the application owner, the DBA has 
			 complete access to the maintenance features provided 
			 in the Maintenance menu (including the maintenance of 
			 objects belonging to other users).
 
             BECAUSE THE APPLICATION OWNER HAS CERTAIN DBA
			 PRIVILEGES, NORMAL USERS SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN THE 
			 APPLICATION OWNER SCHEMA PASSWORD.  (THE DEFAULT NAME 
			 FOR THE APPLICATION OWNER SCHEMA IS SQLDEBUG.)
			 
			 The set of privileges granted to the application owner
			 are -

			 1. connect
			 2. select any table with admin option
			 3. grant any privilege
			 4. create public synonym
			 5. drop public synonym
			 6. unlimited tablespace
			 7. drop any procedure
			 8. create any procedure
			 9. drop any procedure
			10. alter any procedure
			11. execute any procedure
			12. create any trigger
			13. alter any trigger
			14. drop any trigger
		
		- Creates a role PTSQL_DEBUG_ROLE and grants the following
			privileges to this role -

			1. create any procedure
			2. drop any procedure
			3. alter any procedure
			4. execute any procedure
			5. create any trigger 
			6. alter any trigger
			7. drop any trigger
			 
			 The INSTALL.SQL script, located in the Debugger
			 install directory, installs the following objects
			 in the application owner schema.

	   - Creates a table called PTSQL_PLAN_TABLE and grants
             data manipulation privileges on it to PUBLIC. The 
             table is used for getting the execution plan of SQL 
             statements (the user can set an option in the SQL 
             Editor to view the execution plan).

	   - Creates a table called PTSQL_TYPES and grants 
             select privileges on it to PUBLIC. The table is 
             used as a mapping between Oracle native types and 
             SQL-Station Debugger internal data types.

	   - Creates a set of views whose names start with 
             PTSQL_. These views are equivalent to the Oracle 
             ALL_ views but are optimized for faster access 
             through the SQL-Station Debugger catalog browser.

	   - Creates a package called PTSQL_CODE. This package
			contains the logic for reverse engineering all
			Oracle catalog objects. 
	   
	   - Creates a package called PTSQL_SEARCH. This package
			contains the logic to find patterns within the
			Oracle catalog.

           The DBGINST.SQL script, located in the Debugger
           install directory, installs the following objects in
           the application owner schema:
	
	   - Creates a table called PTSQL_DBG_TRIGGERS and 
             grants data manipulation privileges on it to 
             PUBLIC. The table is used only with Oracle Server 
             version 7.1 and earlier. These Oracle versions do 
             not allow more than one trigger of the same type 
             in the catalog. As a result, the trigger text is 
             moved to this table before debugging starts. The 
             table is locked during this process, preventing 
             any data integrity issues.

	   - Creates a table called PTSQL_DBG_IGNORE and 
             grants data manipulation privileges on it to 
             PUBLIC. The table is used by the module exclusion 
             feature, which allows users to selectively 
             exclude objects from debugging.

	   - Creates a sequence called PTSQL_DBG_SEQ. The 
             sequence is used for generating a unique name for 
             debug versions of objects whose names contain more 
             than 26 characters. The normal debug version 
             naming mechanism of prepending 'X#Z$' to the name 
             cannot be applied to these objects because Oracle 
             limits code object name lengths to 30 characters. 
             As a result, the debugger generates a name that 
             consists of 'X#Z$' followed by a unique sequence 
             number.

	   - Creates two tables, PTSQL_DBG_OBJS and 
             PTSQL_FREE_SEQ_NUMS, and a trigger, 
             PTSQL_DBG_OBJS_AFTER_DELETE. These map the debug 
             name to the release name for objects whose name 
             lengths are greater than 26 characters.

	   - Creates a package called PTSQL_DBG_MAINT. This 
             package contains the logic used by the maintenance 
             dialogs.

	   - Creates a package called PTSQL_DEBUG. This 
             package contains the logic used at each step 
             during the debugging process.

	   - Creates a package called PTSQL_DEPEND. This package
			 contains the logic used to generate the dependency
			 tree in the debug window.



        =======================================================
        III. New Features in SQL-Station Debugger 2.0
        -------------------------------------------------------

        The following enhancements have been added since the
        prior release of SQL-Station Debugger (Watch-PL):

         Support for local record variables.

         Support for the Pragma Restrict clause.

         GUI enhancements, including enhancements
          to the Progress mechanism.

         Granularity support allowing you to break at
          ELSIF conditions, GOTO statements, exception
          clauses, loop statements, and so on.

         Support for stepping into functions.

         Support for synonyms, including the ability
          to debug an object referenced by its synonym.

         The capability to debug file system objects that
          have dependencies on objects in the catalog.

		
		. Enhanced support for editing code objects in the debug
		  window - You can switch from the debug window to the
		  edit window by using the 'Edit Code' toobar button.
		  
		  THE SCHEMA NAME HAS TO BE EXPLICITLY SPECIFIED IN THE
		  OBJECT CODE WHEN DEBUGGING OBJECTS IN SCHEMAS OTHER
		  THAN THE ONE REFERRED TO BY THE EDIT WINDOW. 

        =======================================================
        IV. Undocumented Features 
        -------------------------------------------------------
     
         TRIGGERS
          SQL-Station Debugger allows you to step into a trigger when 
          it's activated. You can do this when you're in the 
          process of debugging a stored procedure and a debug
          version of the trigger is deployed on the server. To
          deploy a debug version of the trigger, use the
          Trigger Maintenance dialog. When you step across the 
          statement that activates the trigger, you will step 
          into the trigger.

        
         DEBUGGER SESSIONS
          Each time you click Run or Restart during a debugging 
          session, SQL-Station Debugger checks the datestamp of 
          the original object.  If the datestamp has changed since 
          the creation of the debug version, a message box displays 
          giving you the option of continuing with the current
          debug version or recompiling the debug version to 
          reflect any new changes in the object.


         GROUP LOGINS
          You can create groups of logins and then login to 
          the whole group just by entering the password for 
          each group member when prompted.

          Creating a New Login Group:
          In the PLATINUM SQL-Station Debugger Login dialog, click 
          the Groups button. The dialog changes to the Group Connect
          dialog. To create a new primary (top-level) group, 
          either double-click on Add New Group or highlight 
          Add New Group and click the Add button. Type the 
          name of the new group into the field of the Add New 
          Group dialog and click OK. If an existing group is 
          highlighted when you click the Add button, you 
          can create a new group by choosing Primary Group 
          in the Insert Element Into List dialog.

          Adding Logins to a Group:
          Highlight the group name and click the Add button. 
          Choose Group Item in the Insert Element into List 
          dialog and click OK. In the New Item dialog, enter a 
          connect string and a login name in the appropriate 
          fields and click OK. You can add as many logins as 
          you wish in this manner. 

          Subgroups:
          Groups can have subgroups. To add a subgroup to a 
          group, highlight the group name, click Add, 
          choose Group Item, and click OK. In the New Item 
          dialog, enter a group name in the Connect String/
          Group Name field.  Do not enter anything in the 
          Login name field. Click OK. SQL-Station Debugger adds the named 
          group as a subgroup of the selected primary group. 
          If the named group does not already exist, SQL-Station Debugger 
          creates it as both a Primary Group and as a subgroup.

          Logging in as a group:
          To login as a group, specify the group name in the 
          Connect String field of the login dialog and click 
          Connect. (If you are working in the Group Connect 
          dialog, highlight the group name and click Connect.) 
          SQL-Station Debugger then prompts you to enter the password 
          for each login that is part of the group. If you want to 
          skip a particular login, press Escape or click Cancel 
          when asked for the password.


         VIEWING VARIABLES IN THE WATCH PANE
          During a debugging session, you can choose which 
          variables to view in the Watch pane. To view
          specific variables, follow these steps:
          1. Set your breakpoints and choose Run to go to the
             first breakpoint. At this point, all variables 
             within scope are added to the Variable Tree, 
             located to the left of the Watch pane. By default, 
             all local variables are automatically added to the 
             Watch pane.
          2. To add additional variables to the Watch pane, 
             expand the Variable Tree so that the variable you 
             are interested in is visible, and do one of the 
             following:
              Single-click the variabe to select it and click 
               the Add button directly above the Variable Tree. 
              Single-click the variable and choose Debug, Add 
               Variable from the menu bar.
              Left-click the variable, then right-click and
               choose Add Variable.
             
          The current value of each selected variable is 
          displayed in the Watch pane at each step in the 
          debugging process.

          Notes:
              To add all variables to the Watch pane, 
               select the top level of the Variable Tree 
               ("All Variables") and follow the instructions
               in number 2 above.
              To remove a variable from the Watch pane, click
               the button to the left of its name to highlight
               it, then click the Delete button to the right of 
               the Expression field. You can click multiple 
               buttons before clicking the Delete button.
         
         NETWORK INSTALLATION
          During the installation process, the client-side
          software can be installed either locally or at a
          specified location on a network.

   
         TUTORIAL INSTALLATION
          An icon for installing the tutorial is located in
          the Program Manager.

  
         GRANT DEBUG ROLE
          The Grant Debug Role allows users to debug code 
          objects in other user schemas. During the server-side
          installation, a role named PTSQL_DEBUG_ROLE is
          created, which has privileges required to debug other
          user objects.  The Grant Debug Role dialog is then
          displayed and the DBA is given the option to grant
          this role to users. To add users, click on each user 
          name to be granted and click OK.
 
          SINCE THIS ROLE HAS CERTAIN SYSTEM PRIVILEGES, THE DBA 
          SHOULD USE CAUTION WHEN GRANTING THIS ROLE TO USERS. 

          Once installed, the DBA can grant this role to users
          by executing the following in the Edit Window:

            grant PTSQL_DEBUG_ROLE to <username>;

          To revoke this role from users, execute the following 
          in the Edit Window:

            revoke PTSQL_DEBUG_ROLE from <username>;
          
          The role has the following privileges:
          1. CREATE ANY PROCEDURE and CREATE ANY TRIGGER: this 
             is required for the user to create the debug version 
             of an object under a different owner.
          2. DROP ANY PROCEDURE and DROP ANY TRIGGER: this is 
             required for the user to drop the debug version of 
             an object under a different owner.
          3. ALTER ANY PROCEDURE and ALTER ANY TRIGGER: this is 
             required for the user to do a 'CREATE OR REPLACE 
             <object type>' command under a different owner.
             (See DEBUGGER SESSIONS above for more information.)
          4. EXECUTE ANY PROCEDURE: this is required for the user
             to execute the debug version of an object under a 
             different owner.


        =======================================================
        V. Bug Fixes 
        -------------------------------------------------------

        1.  SQL-Station Debugger no longer flashes when it times
            out and a Procedure Execution window is open.
           
        2. You can successfully include the Pragma Restrict
           clause in a debug version of a procedure.

        3. You can now use the Esc key while an Edit window
           is active (formerly SQL Editor window).

        4. Procedure calls whose arguments include variables with
           package references are now handled properly.

        5. Record variables declared using the table reference 
           type of construction  ("table_name%TYPE") can now be

        6. SQL-Station Debugger now handles error messages correctly.

        7. SQL-Station Debugger searches for one of the following Oracle
           vendor files in your path:

           ORA7NT.DLL
           ORA71.DLL
           ORA71NT.DLL
           ORA72.DLL
           ORA73.DLL

           If none are found, SQL-Station Debugger now displays an error
           message and continues running.

        VI. Known Technical Problems 
        -------------------------------------------------------
       
        1. Dependencies within a PL/SQL package do not show 
           up in the Call Tree. 

        2. The debugger may fail to create a debug version of 
           very large Oracle packages - Oracle has a limit on 
           the maximum size for Oracle packages that is 
           dependent on the mix of statements used. If the debug 
           version of a package exceeds this limit, you will get 
           an Oracle PL/SQL error 'PLS-00123 Program too large'. 
           The workaround is to split them into smaller modules.
