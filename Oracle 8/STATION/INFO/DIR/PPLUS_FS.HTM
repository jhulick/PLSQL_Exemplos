<b>PRODUCT CATEGORY:</b> Application Lifecycle&#151;object-oriented analysis and design tool<br>
<br>
PLATINUM Paradigm Plus is the first object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) tool to support integrated business
process modeling, physical database modeling, and object modeling. It supports Enterprise Component Modeling (ECM), a
strategy for rapidly delivering multi-tiered enterprise applications using object technology and component-based
development techniques. Using ECM, companies can identify business requirements, model and build reusable application
components, and manage information systems over the long term. 
<br>
<br><b>Business Process Modeling</b><br>
Keeping up with changing business demands is critical to the success of any rapid development project. Paradigm Plus
incorporates a powerful business process modeling methodology that helps business managers capture and model a
corporate strategy. Object-Oriented Change and Learning (OOCL) was developed by Innovation Associates, an Arthur D.
Little company co-founded by Peter Senge, the author of The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of a Learning
Organization. The OOCL business process models provide a traceable input to the development process, feeding directly
into the use-case, object, and physical database models generated by Paradigm Plus.
<br>
<br><b>Physical Database Modeling</b><br>
Access to relational database systems (RDBMS), where strategic business data is stored, is critical for most
applications. But mapping OO analysis and design techniques to and from RDBMS tables can be error-prone and time
consuming. Paradigm Plus automates this process, providing a range of options for mapping from an object to an
entity-relationship-type physical database model. By accessing physical database models, Paradigm Plus can generate
or reverse engineer schema for many database environments including Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Microsoft SQL Server,
and IBM DB2.
<br>
<br><b>Object-Oriented Analysis and Design</b><br>
Paradigm Plus automates all leading object-oriented methods including OMT, Fusion, Booch, OOCL, Martin/Odell,
Shlaer/Mellor, Coad/Yourdon, UML V0.9, and others extended to support Jacobson's Use Case modeling. Round-trip
engineering for C++, Visual Basic, Smalltalk, Powerbuilder, PLATINUM ObjectPro, and Forté enables iterative
development and synchronization of designs with implementations. Customizable-code generation is provided for Java,
Delphi, and Ada. A distributed object repository supports large teams of concurrent users, object-level locking,
versioning, and access rights. Components from Paradigm Plus can be published to the web, where they can be searched,
browsed, downloaded, and re-used.

<b>BENEFITS</b>
<br></UL><UL><LI>Manage complex, mission-critical application development through the use of object technology and
component-based development techniques.
<br></UL><UL><LI>Decrease software development and maintenance costs with the ECM strategy, which promotes re-use and
sharing of business models, designs, and development artifacts across multiple projects.
<br></UL><UL><LI>Adapt to changing business requirements by providing traceability between business process, physical
database, and application software models. Design and code remain synchronized as they are modified, resulting in
quicker time to market.
<br></UL><UL><LI>Enhance developer productivity on rapid application development projects with automated support of
the leading OOAD methodologies, easy-to-use diagram and table editors, synchronized design and code, and automatic
code generation for C++, Visual Basic, Smalltalk, Ada, Java, and 4GL/GUI code.
<br></UL><UL><LI>Increase team productivity with concurrent development using a shared, distributed object
repository.
<br></UL><UL><LI>Shorten learning curve and reduce training cost with customizable methodologies. Paradigm Plus runs
on most existing platforms and integrates with leading construction tools.
<br></UL><UL><LI>Reduce risk of obsolescence. Meta-CASE technology supports methods of today and those of tomorrow.
Maintain OO method notation independence with support for the leading OO notations. Legacy designs and code can be
preserved through reverse engineering.
