<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial" COLOR="#333366"><B>Create and Maintain SQL Objects the Easy Way</B></FONT><BR>
With Coder, you can create and edit any server-side objects&#151;tables, stored procedures, and triggers&#151;easily. SQL-Station Coder simplifies the code creation and editing process through code-generation wizards, report wizards, a catalog browser, and an unparalleled editing facility. Coder takes care of syntax and other details, so you can work more productively and deliver robust applications to your users.<BR><BR>
With Coder, you can:
<UL>
<LI>Execute stored procedures and access output easily
<LI>Scan and update table data in spreadsheet format
<LI>View all referential relationships among objects
<LI>Check in and check out objects to and from any SCC-compliant configuration management tool, including PLATINUM CCC/Harvest and other industry standards
<LI>Drag and drop table and column names from the Table Lookup Facility to build queries
<LI>Combine objects into scripts with an advanced scripting facility that automates dependency analysis.
</UL>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial" COLOR="#333366"><B>Browse through Multiple RDBMS Catalogs</B></FONT><BR>
Having access to multiple database catalogs is a must&#151;especially in today's distributed development environments. SQL-Station's catalog browser maintains multiple concurrent connections to client/server RDBMSs on different platforms&#151;Oracle7, SYBASE and Microsoft SQL Server, and ODBC-compliant databases. You can access any object you need quickly and easily, and work more efficiently. You can even search according to an object's contents. Once you find what you need, you can view, edit, execute, or even debug your object at the click of a button.<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial" COLOR="#333366"><B>Speed through the Editing Process</B></FONT><BR>
Now, developers can use an editor built right on top of their database. SQL-Station's editor, based on Premia's CodeWright, was designed to speed up the editing process with advanced features, such as search and replace, drag and drop, syntax highlighting, graphical Grep, bracket matching, API assistance, comment templates, and spell checking&#151;even for scripts larger than 32K. Developers work productively because they can choose among editing modes&#151;Windows Brief, VI, or EMACS.<BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial" COLOR="#333366"><B>Use Object Information to Make Better Maintenance Decisions</B></FONT><BR>
Coder's report wizards generate information about an object or a group of objects in the format you need it. Object Report Wizards provide valuable information that helps you maintain your database objects. Plus, you can output reports as print or e-mail, or export them to Microsoft Word, Excel, or Lotus 1-2-3.<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial" COLOR="#333366"><B>Improve Application Quality with 
Maintenance Shortcuts</B></FONT><BR>
With SQL-Station, you can maintain high
application-quality standards and ensure that your organization's best programming practices are followed by customizing and incorporating them into templates. You can also perform sophisticated maintenance activities. For example, you can drag and drop objects into a compare facility; generate complex scripts, automatically detecting dependencies and ordering scripts accordingly; or even reverse-engineer your database into a script and then alter it.<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial" COLOR="#333366"><B>Execute Your Code</B></FONT><BR>
SQL-Station's advanced query and execution facilities are so comprehensive and powerful they can be used independently for quick, periodic database maintenance in addition to procedure testing. SQL-Station lets you rapidly input arguments and execute your code&#151;even SQL-server system procedures.<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial" COLOR="#333366"><B>Debug Server-Side Objects Quickly</B></FONT><BR>
The SQL-Station Debugger is powerful, easy to use, and fast. Debugger lets you use familiar client-side debugging techniques&#151;even breakpoints, call stacks, and watch variables&#151;in a Windows environment. The time you'd normally spend on server-side debugging and testing, and the frustration you'd experience in the process, are drastically reduced because Debugger is so powerful.<BR><BR>
You can debug, execute, and test any block of PL/SQL code&#151;triggers, procedures, packages, functions, etc. Simply select the object in question, then right click on it to choose the debugging option.<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial" COLOR="#333366"><B>Step through Code to Locate and Fix Bugs</B></FONT><BR>
With Debugger, it's easy to locate problem areas and improve application quality. Simply step through code&#151;statement by statement&#151;as Debugger progressively reveals variable values. Once you find a questionable expression, you can assign new variable values then execute it&#151;in Debugger&#151;to evaluate it. Debugger is safe because it creates new versions without altering your production objects. It's also thorough. Debugger handles multiple input and output variable types, supporting anchored data types, and displays complete server output messages. Once you determine that the code in question is a bug, simply drop into Coder's edit window to fix and execute the source code.<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial" COLOR="#333366"><B>Optimize Your Execution Plans</B></FONT><BR>
Even if it's bug free, there's still no guarantee that your application will perform at optimum speed and efficiency. Research shows that 60 to 80 percent of application performance problems are caused by untuned SQL statements. With Plan Analyzer, you 	can slash response times and drastically improve Oracle7's* SQL performance by supporting optimization activities. Plan Analyzer functions like an expert that answers all your questions about SQL tuning. It presents plans to you graphically, with explanations&#151;reaching far beyond Oracle7's performance statistic and tuning options.<BR><BR>

With Plan Analyzer, you can: 
<UL>
<LI>Analyze optimization plans according to your execution environment
<LI>Capture SQL code that consumes the most resources
<LI>Find frequently used queries that manipulate data based on attributes without a corresponding index
<LI>View performance statistics through easily read, graphical presentations
<LI>Support sophisticated Oracle tuning techniques, such as array binding and hints.
</UL>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial" COLOR="#333366"><B>Capture the SQL Code that Consumes the Most Resources</B></FONT><BR>
Plan Analyzer's flexible, real-time or batch SQL-capture facility traps SQL code and associated optimization plans from database sources and third-party development tools (such as Visual Basic and PowerBuilder). With the capture facility, you can identify SQL that causes slow transactions based on various filters, such as CPU usage, I/O, elapsed time, and more.<BR><BR>
While capturing top offending statements is an important first step, Plan Analyzer also provides optimization expertise. Simply focus on the SQL 	you need to optimize&#151;Plan Analyzer can take care of the rest.<BR><BR>


<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial" COLOR="#333366"><B>Empower Expert and Novice Users</B></FONT><BR>
Regardless of your experience level, you can perform sophisticated SQL optimization functions. Plan Analyzer guides you through the optimization process intuitively, offering a choice of methods: rule-based, cost-based, or custom methods with hints. It steps you through plans line by line, optionally providing explanations in plain English and animating plans to reveal execution flow. In expert and standard modes, Plan Analyzer makes it easy to choose the right hints. In standard mode, it will even select optimal plans for you.<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial" COLOR="#333366"><B>Let Plan Analyzer Evaluate Your Plan</B></FONT><BR>
Plan Analyzer evaluates your plan according to its run-time environment. It then provides a complete list of objects accessed, a detailed statistical analysis of each accessed object, and a list of alternate access paths for each plan. It even color-codes alarm and warning conditions according to the thresholds you define.<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial" COLOR="#333366"><B>Use the Repository for Change Detection and Management</B></FONT><BR>
Users can run reports and access or save valuable information in the Plan Analyzer Repository&#151;including current work, previously tuned plans, SQL statements, and performance statistics. If performance suddenly drops, a simple query reveals recent changes, helping you locate the offending SQL quickly.<BR><BR>

Over time, Oracle-generated optimization plans, growing table size, and changing indexes will alter your database. Plan Analyzer allows you to run reports to determine how your database has changed. You can find out if, for example, your SQL calls an extinct or rarely used index. Or, you can search for and compare a recently saved plan to a production plan.<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Arial" COLOR="#333366"><B>Get All You Need from SQL-Station</B></FONT><BR>
SQL-Station is the only tool on the market that integrates three powerful development phases through the same GUI environment, enabling you to deliver better database applications, faster. With SQL-Station, you can create, test, debug, and maintain server-side objects (stored procedures, triggers, functions, packages, tables, and indexes) and optimize SQL statements&#151;all from a single GUI environment.
SQL-Station will continue to evolve in response to advancing technologies and developer needs. Future SQL-Station plans include support for additional databases and extended Web support.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
