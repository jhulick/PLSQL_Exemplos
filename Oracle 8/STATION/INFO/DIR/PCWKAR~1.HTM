<P>Writing Oracle7 Database code feels a lot like going 10 rounds with a
heavyweight champ: You've proved you're tough, but you're sure there
must be a better way. Early relief is in sight with Platinum Technology
Inc.'s powerful new SQL-Station. Integrating three market-leading
editing, debugging and profiling tools into a seamless environment,
SQL-Station is the first complete development tool PC Week Labs has seen
for Oracle Corp.'s Oracle7.</P>
<P>Its broad range of features, user interface and integration are
unmatched, besting Oracle's own tools along with competing products from
DBE Software Inc. and Sylvain Faust Inc. and establishing itself as a PC
Week Labs Analyst's Choice.</P>

<FONT size=-1><B>With Platinum's SQL-Station Debugger, we could see breakpoints and variables while debugging a stored procedure. The debugger is directly integrated with the editor.</B> <I>(click image to see full size version)</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>We did find a few minor problems in the product's editing and
reporting procedures, but SQL-Station's most significant limitation is
that its debugger and profiler only work with Oracle7, shutting out
users of other databases. However, other features including
SQL-Station's code editing environment, reverse engineering tools and
database object browser also can be used with Sybase Inc.'s SQL Server
and Microsoft Corp.'s SQL Server; limited editing is also provided for
any database that complies with the ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)
standard. SQL-Station itself runs on Windows 95 or Windows NT.</P>
<P>Along with either a client/server or general-purpose development
tool, SQL-Station is a product no Oracle7 database developer should do
without. Though not targeted at database administrators, the product's
profiler and repository also will serve these users well.</P>
<P>Released at the beginning of the year, the full suite is priced at
$2,995 per user, which is competitive with other SQL development
products. Components also can be purchased separately; the profiler is
$2,495, the editing environment is $695, and the editor and debugger
together are $1,395.</P>
<H3>
Putting the pieces together
</H3>
<P>PC Week Labs tested Platinum's product using both an Oracle7 and a
Microsoft SQL Server database. SQL-Station's editing environment, called
SQL-Station Coder, presented us with an Explorer-style tree view listing
database objects such as tables, tablespaces, indexes, packages and
procedures.</P>
<P>We could have several database connections open simultaneously,
making it easy to flip between development and production servers.
However, we would have liked to be able to drag and drop objects between
databases from the same vendor or to compare server objects to later
versions of the same objects.</P>
<P>SQL-Station's editing environment, previously available as a separate
product, takes big steps forward with the inclusion of Premia Corp.'s
Codewright programming editor, which provides syntax highlighting and
function help customized for the programming languages of each supported
database.</P>
<P>Codewright provided familiar functions such as automatically inserted
comment blocks, grep search-and-replace capabilities, bracket matching
and keyboard emulation for popular Unix editors, including EMACS and vi.
We also could use built-in template wizards to get a quick start
creating tables or packages. SQL-Station Coder integrates with a variety
of source code management systems, an essential feature for team
development.</P>
<P>Surprisingly, we found some of the Codewright windows (such as the
search across files window) didn't work at all; Platinum officials later
confirmed that the company has licensed only a subset of the full
product. A spelling checker is included but is nearly useless, as it
doesn't ignore source code in its check.</P>
<P>In addition to creating new objects, we could reverse-engineer any
database object to code, modify this code and then run it directly from
the editor. We also could edit the data within database objects in a
grid control; many other packages require developers to write insert
statements to do this.</P>
<P>SQL-Station Coder generates database reports with a Crystal Reports
control that comes with the package, but the selection of reports is
limited compared with other products, such as Sylvain Faust's SQL
Programmer.</P>
<P>SQL-Station Debugger is directly integrated into the editor (a change
from the previous version) and allows in-place debugging of PL/SQL
scripts (see screen, above left). The debugger runs as a server process,
which means SQL-Station automatically supports the 2.0 release of PL/SQL
and supports triggers and other server-side-only objects.</P>
<P>The fact that the debugger doesn't run on the client also means
SQL-Station had to generate special debug versions of our server
procedures before we could step into them, which slowed us down
initially. We could inspect and modify variables at breakpoints, modify
code to fix a bug, and recompile procedures with only a few
keystrokes.</P>

<FONT size=-1><B>SQL-Station Plan Analyzer graphically displayed the execution path of a SQL query we submitted. The Visualize Window suggested ways to speed execution.</B> <I>(click image to see full size version)</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>The third major component of SQL-Station is its Plan Analyzer, which
analyzes the execution path of a submitted SQL statement and suggests
optimizations (see screen, below left). Plan Analyzer interactively
analyzed executing statements on our server and presented the slowest or
most resource-hungry queries for hand tuning.</P>
<P>Plan Analyzer works very well as an interactive Oracle monitor; we
could look at top resource consumers either by statement or by owner and
track down which queries or which users were bringing down server
response time.</P>
<P>Plan Analyzer includes a novice mode, which expands on Oracle's
cryptic Explain Plan results and suggests improvements from its
knowledge base.</P>
<P>Advanced users will find much for them also, as Plan Analyzer
supports the full set of Oracle 7.x hints (including Parallel Server
hints and star schema hints). Plan Analyzer even included a hint wizard
that walked us through the process of hinting our queries
appropriately.</P>
<P>Administrators still learning SQL but wanting to do some tuning of
SQL code should investigate Precise Software Solutions Inc.'s
Precise/SQL, which can rewrite SQL automatically based on heuristics, a
capability Plan Analyzer lacks.</P>
