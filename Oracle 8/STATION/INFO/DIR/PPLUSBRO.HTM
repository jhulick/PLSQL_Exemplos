SIZE=1>tm</FONT></SUP> to develop critical
applications--quickly</FONT></B><BR>
 <BR>
 When business policies change, development teams must be able to respond
by building and re-engineering critical applications rapidly. The question
is, how can you focus on both productivity and quality in your fast-paced
development environment? <BR>
 <BR>
 By combining the benefits of Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)
and PLATINUM Paradigm Plus, you can easily maintain a high level of quality
while facilitating rapid application development. Object reuse and project
visualization, inherent in OOAD, are augmented by Paradigm Plus' unique
development strategy, Enterprise Component Modeling (ECM<SUP><FONT
SIZE=1>tm</FONT></SUP>). ECM supports
object technology and component-based design, helping you deliver multi-tiered,
enterprise-scalable applications simply and easily--regardless of your object
method/notation. <BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 <B><FONT SIZE="4">Benefit from a Unique Development Strategy</FONT></B><BR>
 <BR>
 ECM is a repository-based application development process that promotes
component reuse across projects--across the distributed enterprise--so critical
applications can be developed and maintained easily. Local and remote developers
can view project designs and share well-defined application components,
ensuring the robustness of their applications. <BR>
 <BR>
 Paradigm Plus easily lifts application components out of existing code
and includes them in the Paradigm Plus object repository. Development, maintenance,
and even migration costs are drastically reduced because instead of re-creating
application components, developers can easily locate, view, and edit them
from the Paradigm Plus object repository. <BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 <B><FONT SIZE="4">Use Any Object Modeling Technique</FONT></B><BR>
 <BR>
 Paradigm Plus supports multiple modeling methods, including <B>Rumbaugh/OMT, Fusion,
Martin/Odell OOIE, Booch,
Coad/Yourdon, Unified, </B>and <B>Shlaer/Mellor,</B> so your chosen method is sure to be
supported. <BR>
 <BR>
 Project models can be created from scratch through the Paradigm Plus Diagram
Editor or automatically generated from object definitions in the repository.
This powerful, time-saving capability is strengthened by consistency checks
that protect your project models--and ultimately your entire application.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 <B><FONT SIZE="4">Develop Multi-tiered Applications with Ease</FONT></B><BR>
 <BR>
 Paradigm Plus enables you to define clients, servers, networks, and databases
through its powerful Network Architecture Model, which is composed of architecture
diagrams. Architecture diagrams partition the layers, or tiers, of your
enterprise application--such as its user interface, business rules, and
persistent storage--and enable you to view details that help you visualize
and deploy enterprise-scalable applications. <BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 <B><FONT SIZE="4">Share Project Information and Focus on Development</FONT></B><BR>
 <BR>
 PLATINUM Paradigm Plus stores your application components and all valuable
information about these components--in the Paradigm Plus object repository.
Project design, objects, and object information can all be viewed and edited
from the repository, so users can manipulate and perfect application components.
What's more, repositories can be geographically distributed, so developers
across your enterprise can easily share application components and view
project designs through virtual, geographically distributed repositories. <BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 <B><FONT SIZE="4">Get a Quick Start on Your Application</FONT></B><BR>
 <BR>
 In addition to providing a platform that enables you to maintain and share
application components across your distributed enterprise, Paradigm Plus
also generates code from your objects. <BR>
 <BR>
 Paradigm Plus generates fully compilable object class definitions according
to application designs and object specifications stored in the object repository.
It directly supports <BR>

<LI>Fort&eacute; 
<LI>SQL 
<LI>JAVA 
<LI>Corba IDL* 
<LI>Visual Basic* 
</UL>
<P>It also supports other languages through its powerful scripting facility.
Paradigm Plus allows you to specify the target database, user interface,
and network distribution protocol for generated code, and customize the
code output to conform to company specifications. So no matter how unique
your environment is, you can always tailor code generation to support it. <BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 <B><FONT SIZE="4">Support Web Development</FONT></B><BR>
 <BR>
 Paradigm Plus is the only analysis and design tool to support World Wide
Web (WWW) application development by generating JAVA code. Web developers
can visualize, plan, and construct JAVA applications efficiently and cost
effectively, benefiting from Paradigm Plus' analysis and design capabilities.
Paradigm Plus also exports components as HTML, so developers who don't have
direct access to Paradigm Plus can view component specifications, models,
and other design information through the WWW. <BR>
 <BR>

<CENTER><P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><I>Since we started using Paradigm Plus, late project
completion dates and
cost overruns have markedly decreased. We have been able to avoid many of
the expensive software errors that formerly plagued us. Our development
environment has dramatically improved with Paradigm Plus. </I></B><BR>

</CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE="4">Reuse Any Enterprise Object</FONT></B><BR>
 <BR>
 Paradigm Plus puts your objects to work, not your developers. Once part
of the repository, application components are available to members of your
distributed enterprise for use in multiple projects. Developers in Europe,
for example, can easily find, view, and reference existing objects or project
designs for use in their local project model, specifying versions of objects
as necessary. Object reuse frees your developers and ensures that resources
are used to their fullest potential, now and in the future. What's more,
consistency is maintained, and resources are conserved because objects are
referenced from their original sources, not copied. <BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 <B><FONT SIZE="4">Maximize Resources by Supporting Concurrent Development</FONT></B><BR>
 <BR>
 Development teams working on different projects or the same project can
simultaneously access the object repository. They can interactively manipulate
project models, application components, and attached objects, creating new
versions of components as needed. Conflicts are avoided by mechanisms that
prevent one developer from overwriting another developer's changes. Your
critical applications not only benefit from collective input, but also get
to market faster because they are designed efficiently.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 <B><FONT SIZE="4">Change Views at Your Convenience</FONT></B><BR>
 <BR>
 Paradigm Plus allows developers at different locations to use individual
object repositories, yet view a single, virtual enterprise repository. Four
views are available. In a single session, developers can simultaneously
view project information through the Diagram Editor, Object Browser, Matrix
Editor, and Table Editor. All four repository views support interactive
editing and enforce referential integrity, so when you alter your project
model or table, changes can be reflected immediately in the object repository
and other active views. <BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 <B><FONT SIZE="4">Refine and Maintain Your Applications with Round-trip
Engineering</FONT></B><BR>
 <BR>
 Round-trip engineering synchronizes project design with its corresponding
implementation, so you can fine-tune your application at any stage. You
can use forward-engineering to generate new code from object classes, or
reverse-engineering to translate altered application components into object
classes. You can make any number of changes in as many iterations as desired--Paradigm
Plus maintains the original source file, updating specific sections as required.
This process, known as incremental code generation, saves development time
and helps reduce the costs of migration and ongoing application maintenance.<BR>

</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE="4">Visualize Your Applications</FONT></B><BR>
 <BR>
 When you use reverse-engineering to extract object classes from existing
code and publish them in the Paradigm Plus repository, your whole development
organization benefits. Developers can easily migrate and maintain applications
through their extracted components as well as reuse components in other
projects. Capitalizing on enterprise knowledge is easy, because you can view
your applications--your entire development environment if desired--through
the repository.</CENTER><BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 <B><FONT SIZE="4">Generate Custom Project Reports and Formal
Documentation--Automatically</FONT></B><BR>
 <BR>
 Automatic report generation keeps developers abreast of ongoing projects.
Paradigm Plus automatically generates reports that cover various aspects
of project development, including statistics, project and object models,
data dictionaries, consistency checks, and more. Reports are script-generated,
so you can customize them according to your specific needs.<BR>
 <BR>
 Paradigm Plus also generates formal project documentation, supporting Microsoft
Word, Interleaf, and FrameMaker desktop publishing programs through ATA's
DocEXPRESS. Explicit and readable project directives can be generated not
only to guide development teams, but also to inform other parties of project
direction.<BR>
