This file contains instructions for installing the trial version 2.1 of
the Oracle Web Server 2.1 for Solaris.  This directory contains two files:

install.txt   This readme file
40bit.tar     Unix tar file containing the release

Directions for installing:

1) Copy the tar file to your $ORACLE_HOME directory.

2) From $ORACLE_HOME, extract the file using the following command:
   tar xvf 40bit.tar
   This will create a directory $ORACLE_HOME/ows21, and also create 4
   new executables in $ORACLE_HOME/bin.

3) Go to $ORACLE_HOME/ows21/admin, and run install.sh.  This will setup and
   start the default administration listener.  Follow the directions given
   by install.sh to do this.

3) After you run install.sh, the script will direct you to start your
   web browser and connect to the adminstration listener.  This will prompt
   you for a username and password.  The username is 'admin' (without the
   single quotes) and the password is 'manager' (without the single quotes).
