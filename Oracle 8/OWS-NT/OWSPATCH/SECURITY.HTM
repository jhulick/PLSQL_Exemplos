<H3>Enhanced Security Utility for Oracle WebServer</H3>

<P>Oracle has noticed that sites using Oracle WebServer are building real
applications based on sample applications distributed with the product.
These samples were not designed for maximum security, but rather to demonstrate
basic functionality of the product. </P>

<P>Oracle has prepared a <A HREF="secure.htm">White Paper</A> documenting
how to design secure PL/SQL applications for the web. Simple adjustments
described in the paper are automated by a security utility, distributed
as a patch for older version of Oracle WebServer. You should download this
utility if you are running any version of Oracle WebServer prior to 2.1.0.3
on any platform.<BR>
