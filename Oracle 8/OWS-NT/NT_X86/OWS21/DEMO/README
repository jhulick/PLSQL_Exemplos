                             [Oracle WebServer]

                      Oracle WebServer Demonstrations

The Oracle WebServer demo directory contains source-code for one demo
using the PL/SQL Agent.

Oracle Travel demonstrates a complex train ticket purchasing
application.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to install
--------------

The Travel Demo is automatically installed into the OWA_DBA DCD, which
runs on the Administration Listener. If you would like to install it
using a different DCD, you must follow the following steps.

  1. Create a new DCD

  2. Reconfigure Oracle Web Listener

     If your listener does not have a virtual directory named /tr-img, you
     must create it using the Oracle Web Listener administration screen. The
     directory should be mapped to the physical directory
     ${ORACLE_HOME}/ows21/demo/img/

  3. Install Database Objects

     Using server manager line mode (svrmgrl), connect to the Oracle account
     corresponding to the DCD created in step 1. Run the script
     "demoins.sql":

             SVRMGR> @?/ows21/demo/demoins

     NOTE: If you wish to rerun demoins, please run demodrop.sql first.

     NOTE: If you fail to create the TR and TRU packages due to insufficient
     free space in the shared pool (SGA), either increase the init.ora
     parameter shared_pool_size and restart Oracle7, or issue the following
     command while connected as INTERNAL to defragment the shared pool:

             alter system flush shared_pool;

     Then reconnect to the demo user, and run trui.sql. You do not have to
     run trdrop.sql or demodrop.sql first.

  4. Reload Web Listener

     Stop and then restart the Oracle Web Listener from the Oracle Web
     Listener Administration page. This will cause it to reload its
     configuration file, which is necessary in order for the above directory
     mapping changes to take effect.

  5. Run the Demo!

     Connect to the demo from the WebServer Home Page or with the following
     URL:

             http://your.host:port/demo/owa/tr.splash

        o your.host is your official hostname
        o port is the TCP port for the Oracle Web Listener
        o demo is the service name(s) created in step 1

     Note: If you are unable to connect to the demo at this point, check the
     logfiles in $ORACLE_HOME/ows/log for possible diagnostics. Also, make
     sure you are specifying the right port in the URL. If you do not get
     the demo images loaded correctly, manually check the Oracle Web
     Listener configuration and repeat step 4. Use "View source" in your
     browser to see where the images are expected to be.

     Warning: The TR demo implements a detailed audit trail in the TX_DATA
     table, which grows rapidly under heavy use. It is safe to truncate the
     table periodically, or disable the audit trail by manually editing the
     procedure "tx.put" in the file trbuild.sql, commenting out the insert
     statement.
