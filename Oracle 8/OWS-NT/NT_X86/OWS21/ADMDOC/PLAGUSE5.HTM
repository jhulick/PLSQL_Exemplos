Oracle PL/SQL Agent Error Handling

There are two types of errors that the Oracle PL/SQL Agent handles:<P>
</A><ul type=disc><A NAME="998268">
<LI>Application Errors. These are the responsibility of the application developer.
</A>
<A NAME="998269">
<LI>System Errors. These are usually the responsibility of the WebServer administrator, although they also occur when application errors are not handled.

An application error is an error that occurs while PL/SQL code is executing and that is handled by that code. When an application error occurs, the PL/SQL code generates an HTML error page, which is transmitted to the client's browser instead of the normal output. This sort of error is transparent to the PL/SQL Agent itself and to WebServer. Since the request was processed and an HTML page was transmitted to the client's browser, the operation was successful as far as WebServer is concerned. The user will see whatever handled exception message is generated by the PL/SQL procedure. If you do not want this result, you should allow to error to propagate to the PL/SQL Agent as a system error (see <a href="plaguse5.htm#998272">System Errors</a> below). <P>

To find out how to handle exceptions in PL/SQL, see <em>Handling Exceptions</em> under "Overview of the Oracle7 Server, SQL, and PL/SQL" in the Introduction to the Oracle WebServer.<P>

System Errors
</A>
</H2>
<A NAME="998273">
System errors are detected by the PL/SQL Agent itself. These are errors that occur when the PL/SQL Agent is unable to launch the initial PL/SQL procedure or when a PL/SQL exception is not handled by the application. This causes a standard HTML error page to be returned to the browser. Which standard error page is sent is determined by the <a href="plaguse1.htm#997971">owa_err_page</a> parameter of the <a href="gloss.htm#421241">DCD</a> that was specified in the client's request.<P>
</A><A NAME="998274">
For example, if the PL/SQL Agent cannot logon to the database, the PL/SQL application cannot run and a system error occurs. The PL/SQL Agent then returns the error page specified in <a href="plaguse1.htm#997971">owa_err_page</a>. <P>
