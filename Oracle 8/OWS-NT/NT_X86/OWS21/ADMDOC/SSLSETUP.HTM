Setting Up a Secure Oracle WebServer
</A>
</H1>
<HR><P><A NAME="421061">
You can up an Oracle WebServer process to accept secure connections on a particular TCP/IP <a href="gloss.htm#422250">port</a> by configuring it to use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) on that port. SSL is an emerging standard for encrypted data transmission--see Chapter 3, "The Secure Sockets Layer" in <em><a href="owsintro.pdf">Introduction to the Oracle WebServer</a></em> for an introduction to the terms and concepts involved in this kind of security.<P>
</A><A NAME="420160">
To set up your Oracle WebServer to use SSL, you must do the following:<P>
</A><OL TYPE=1>
<A NAME="420090">
<LI>Generate a <a href="gloss.htm#421293">certificate</a> request.<P>
</A>
<A NAME="420091">
<LI>Send the request to VeriSign, Inc., a Certifying Authority (<a href="gloss.htm#421196">CA</a>).<P>
</A>
<A NAME="420092">
<LI>Physically secure and prepare your WebServer host machine.<P>
</A>
<A NAME="420093">
<LI>Install the certificate granted you by the CA.<P>

<LI>Activate SSL on at least one WebServer port.<P>

Generating a Certificate Request
</A>
</H3>
<A NAME="420096">
To generate a certificate request, run the interactive utility <code>genreq</code> and enter the information for which it prompts you. When the prompt specifies a default value, you can just press return to enter that value, or enter a different value if you prefer. For an example of how to use genreq, see the sample <code>genreq</code> session that accompanies this document. To run <code>genreq</code>, do the following:<P>
</A><OL TYPE=1>
<A NAME="420193">
<LI>Type <code>genreq</code> to start the utility.<P>
</A>
<A NAME="420908">
<LI>Type <code>G</code> to begin creating a certificate request.<P>
</A>
<A NAME="420910">
<LI>When prompted, type a password, used in generating the <a href="gloss.htm#421346">private key</a>. Just choose a random string of characters--you need only remember this string long enough to repeat it in the next step.<P>
</A>
<A NAME="420914">
<LI>Retype the password for confirmation.<P>
</A>
<A NAME="420917">
<LI>Choose the public exponent you want to use in generating the <a href="gloss.htm#421202">key pair</a>. The only two recognized exponents are 3 and 65537, commonly called Fermat 4 or F4.<P>
</A>
<A NAME="420918">
<LI>Enter the size in bits of the modulus you want to use in generating the key pair. For the version of genreq sold in the United States of America, the size may be from 1 to 1024. The default size is 768 bits and the maximum is 1024 bits. A modulus size between these two values is recommended.<P>
</A>
<A NAME="420214">
For versions of <code>genreq</code> sold outside the USA, the maximum (and default) modulus size is 512 bits.<P>
</A>
<A NAME="420215">
<LI>Choose one of three methods for generating a random seed to use in generating the key pair:<P>
</A>
<ul type=square>
<A NAME="420218">
<LI>F--<code>genreq</code> prompts you to enter the full pathname of a file in your local file system. This can be any file that is at least 256 bytes in size, does not contain any secret information, and has contents that cannot easily be guessed.
</A>
<A NAME="420248">
<LI>K--<code>genreq</code> prompts you to enter random keystrokes. <code>genreq</code> uses the variation in time between keystrokes to generate the seed. Don't use the keyboard's autorepeat capability, and don't wait longer than two seconds between keystrokes. <code>genreq</code> prompts you when you have typed enough keystrokes. You must delete any unused characters typed after this prompt.
</A>
<A NAME="420249">
<LI>B--genreq prompts you to enter both a file name and random keystrokes. This option is recommended.
</A>
</ul>
<A NAME="420252">
<LI>Enter the name of a file in which to store your WebServer's distinguished name. You can choose the default, or enter any filename with a <code>.der</code> extension. <code>genreq</code> creates this file in the current directory, though you may later move it to any convenient location.<P>
</A>
<A NAME="420253">
<LI>Enter the name of a file in which to store your WebServer's private key. You can choose the default, or enter any filename with a <code>.der</code> extension. <code>genreq</code> creates this file in the current directory, though you may later move it to any convenient location.<P>

Preparing Your WebServer Host Machine
</A>
</H3>
<A NAME="420110">
For your WebServer to be secure as advertised to clients, you must make sure that no unauthorized person has access to your WebServer's host machine. Here are some suggestions:<P>
</A><ul type=disc><A NAME="420111">
<LI>Place the machine in a locked server room.
</A>
<A NAME="420112">
<LI>Limit distribution of keys or combinations to the server room to a few trusted individuals.
</A>
<A NAME="420113">
<LI>Set up a secure area of the machine's file system that can be accessed only by the root user. This is where you will store your private key and your certificate when you receive it.
</A>
<A NAME="420114">
<LI>Set a secure root password on the machine, using at least six characters and mixing numbers, legal punctuation marks, and mixed-case letters. Try not to use a character string that is a proper name or a word in any language. Change passwords frequently, and never write a password on paper.
</A>
<A NAME="420115">
<LI>Strictly limit the programs that are installed and allowed to run on the machine.
</A>
<A NAME="420116">
<LI>Limit TCP/IP connections to the machine to port 443, the default port for secure connections. Disable all other ports.
</A>
</ul><A NAME="420117">
