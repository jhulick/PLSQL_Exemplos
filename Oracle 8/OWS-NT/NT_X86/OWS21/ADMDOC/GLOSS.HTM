<DT>WRB
</A><DD>Acronym for Web Request Broker. This is the core of the Oracle WebServer architecture. The Web Request Broker passes http requests that require the running of Server programs to various processes (WRB Executable Engines or WRBX's) that continuously run and await such requests. The WRB also includes an open API, so you can run your own Server programs under it. The WRB is a more efficient alternative to the industry-standard CGI, but it can process requests that use CGI environment variables.<P>

<DT>WRB Execution Instance (WRBX)
</A><DD>One of a pool of processes that the WRB maintains continuously, so that HTTP requests requiring the execution of programs are not slowed down by the performance cost of spawning a new process. WRBX's are associated with WRB Cartridges and are created and destroyed according to workload.<P>
